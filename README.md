# Ghidra XBE Loader

This is a Ghidra plugin that allows opening `.xbe` files. These files were used
by the original Xbox to store executables, so this allows reverse-engineering
them in Ghidra.

## Installing

(TODO: Provide pre-built extension .zip)

## Contributing

There's still a few things to implement or figure out about Ghidra's API, so
feel free to send a Pull Request.
